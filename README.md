Small Sveltekit + typescript demo

Allows you to:
1. Build a simple questionnaire
2. Preview the questionnaire
3. submit answers
4. store them in memory

Running the project

Install dependencies:
npm install

start dev server and open browser:
npm run dev -- --open

Assumptions:
- Storage is fully in memory, so refresh/restarts reset data
- focus is on structure, UI is basic
- Due to time constraints, viewing of answers is minimal
